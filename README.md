On this project, I created a simple grocery program. 
Assumption: a vendor has a text file with the name of each item they sell throughout the day on a new line.

With this program, a user would name their text file "Groceries.txt" and be able to have the program search for the number of occurrences of any particular item that was sold, as defined by the user, or list each item
with a numerical count for their occurrences, or a histogram of asterisks for the number of occurrences.

This program runs well on the golden path. This is assuming the user does not enter any obviously incorrect input (such as entering 7 on a menu that lists 1-4 as options).

Code can be enhanced for error handling and to be more user-proof. I can iterate on this code to implement try catch for any exceptions, some extra statements to advise the user of incorrect inputs, and so on. This 
would make the program more secure, less prone to crashing or bugs, and more efficient in that a user would not be able to enter incorrect information which would possibly create an exception.

The most difficult part to write for this code was to read through the file provided and grab each word and the number of occurrences for that word. This was done using a map, which I have never used before. Lots of 
Googling to get that implemented.

Searching for solutions to issues I ran into will be particularly useful in a professional setting. This is something that will never stop happening, and the quicker I can learn to search for the appropriate
keywords to find the information I need and find a way to implement it, the better I will be at this, and the better my code will be.
